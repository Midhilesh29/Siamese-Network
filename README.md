# Siamese-Network
1. Siamese Network was built and was trained on MNIST dataset.
2. TSNE dimensinality reduction was used to reduce the dimensions to 2D of actual images and transformed images by siamese network.
3. These dimensinality reduced images were scatter plotted for understanding the Siamese network.
